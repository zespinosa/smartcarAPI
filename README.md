# SmartCar API 

In this short project I create an API following the SmartCar Interview Spec. This API overlays the GMI API to create a friendly user experience.
Testing is completed using Postman. The server is written using Javascript, NodeJS, and Express. The work horse of this project is the request library,
which wraps NodeJs http requests.

## Getting Started

Download all files. Run node server.js to run locally.
